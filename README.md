# ASRHAE Standard 211 Translator

Python Script for Translating ASHRAE Standard 211's Normative Spreadsheet

The script depends on openpxyl (version 2.4.9), bugs in later versions prevent the script from loading the spreadsheet. This version is not yet a proper Python package, and is not yet automatically tested.
